=====

* eliminate hardcoding in the weighing of both scores.
* Maybe a better charting role, using Chart::Clicker?
* Extend for different sequence alphabets:
   * $proth_alph
   * _init
* terminate should be passed the fittest Seq object (score included),
  rather than the fittest string. This way you can cleanly make tests
  on the current score.
