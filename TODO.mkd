* Extend for different sequence alphabets:
   * $proth_alph
   * _init

* Migrate to MooseX::Types.
* Eliminate the Bio::Root::Root crap
* Change name to Bio::Evolver or just Evolver. What are the chances that
this thing is going to be added to Bioperl? It uses Moose
AI::Genetic::Pro, so it won't be added to the *current* BioPerl. And the
BioMoose one, not until I can have all the BioPerl dependencies ported
to BioMoose, so not by a long shot.
